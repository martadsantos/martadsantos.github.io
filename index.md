A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to model a music genre classification task using the GTZAN dataset, comprising 100 music samples of 30 seconds each for 10 different music genres. 

The CNN model is trained using data augmentation along with regularization techniques, resulting in an accuracy of 86% for unseen music samples.
